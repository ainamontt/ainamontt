## Hi, hola, I`m Ana  👋

I'm a curious and solution-oriented person who enjoys understanding how things work and how to make them better. With a background in engineering and project management, I've developed strong skills in planning, strategic thinking, and execution.

Now, as a Full-Stack Developer, I bring that mindset into tech — building applications that are both functional and user-friendly. I enjoy meaningful challenges and working on projects where technology creates a real, positive impact — especially when building functional, user-friendly solutions.
